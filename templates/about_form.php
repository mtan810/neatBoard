Hi. Inspired by popular websites such as Reddit, Twitter, 4chan, 2channel, Futaba, etc., I have decided to try and implement my
own version of an online message board for CS50's final project. The result is neatBoard, an online discussion website/message board
that allows users to talk about subjects in the form of posted messages. neatBoard hosts a variety of popular subjects: Anime, Manga,
Film, Literature, TV, Music, Games, Sports, News, Tech, Programming, and Miscellaneous. These subjects are subjected to change, and more
may be added later. The users may choose which subject are of interest to them and can view all subjects if they want.<br /><br />
Registration is required before viewing. But once the users register and log in, they can begin to explore all the possibilities 
this message board has to offer. Users will be able to go to different subjects, create and view topics within each subject, and 
post comments within each topic. The users are given the choice to post as "Anon" or with their usernames and select a theme to apply
to the websitei n the account setting on the top right corner.<br /><br />
Rules will be implemented soon enough. Stay tuned for more information or go to Contact Us if you need to ask anything!
